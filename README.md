Jekyll Boilerplate
================

#### About
** Still a work in progress **
An attempt at making jekyll more modular, and breaking things out into page parts.

Includes the grid from bootstrap 3, as well as a small boilerplate I created. Both Sass and JS is written very modularly as well. Dependencies on Waypoints & inview for scrolling functions.
Also contains some interesting class toggle functions, all still WIP.

#### Config
Most of the config is handled via standard jekyll config variables in the _config.yml, there are environments that can be setup through editing the _config_prod.html and the _config_stage.html files. Based on the architecture discussed [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27386169/change-site-url-to-localhost-during-jekyll-local-development/).
