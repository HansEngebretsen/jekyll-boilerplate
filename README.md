Jekyll Boilerplate
================

** Still a work in progress **

An attempt at making jekyll more modular, and breaking things out into page parts. Both Sass and JS is written very modularly as well. Dependencies on Waypoints & inview for scrolling functions.

Also contains some interesting class toggle functions, all still WIP.
