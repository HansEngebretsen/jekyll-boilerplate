Jekyll Boilerplate
================

** Still a work in progress **

An attempt at making jekyll more modular, and breaking things out into page parts.


Includes the grid from bootstrap 3, as well as a small boilerplate I created. Both Sass and JS is written very modularly as well. Dependencies on Waypoints & inview for scrolling functions.

Also contains some interesting class toggle functions, all still WIP.
